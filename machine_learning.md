## The Basics

# Welcome to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a way of taking data and turning it into insights.
We use computer power to analyze examples from the past to build a model that can predict the result for new examples.

We encounter machine learning models every day.
For example, when Netflix recommends a show to you, they used a model based on what you and other users have watched to predict what you would like. When Amazon chooses a price for an item, they use a model based on how similar items have sold in the past. When your credit card company calls you because of suspicious activity, they use a model based on your past activity to recognize anomalous behavior.

In this course weâ€™ll learn several techniques for solving machine learning problems.
Machine Learning can be used to create a chatbot, detect spam or image recognition.
