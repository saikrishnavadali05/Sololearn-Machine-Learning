## The Basics

# Welcome to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a way of taking data and turning it into insights.
We use computer power to analyze examples from the past to build a model that can predict the result for new examples.

- Machine learning models every day : 
   * Netflix recommendations 
   * Amazon Pricing System 
   * credit card company calls based on suspicious activity (anamolous behaviour prediction models)

- Machine Learning can be used to :
   * create a chatbot
   * detect spam 
   * image recognition.

- Approach : 
   * Python (Programming Language)
   * Pandas (library) for reading data and data manipulation
   * Numpy (library) is used for computations of numerical data
   * Matplotlib (library) is used for graphing data
   * scikit-learn (library) is used for machine learning models
