## The Basics

# Welcome to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a way of taking data and turning it into insights.
We use computer power to analyze examples from the past to build a model that can predict the result for new examples.

- Machine learning models every day : 
   * Netflix recommendations 
   * Amazon Pricing System 
   * credit card company calls based on suspicious activity (anamolous behaviour prediction models)

- Machine Learning can be used to :
   * create a chatbot
   * detect spam 
   * image recognition.

- Approach : 
   * Python (Programming Language)
   * Pandas (library) for reading data and data manipulation
   * Numpy (library) is used for computations of numerical data
   * Matplotlib (library) is used for graphing data
   * scikit-learn (library) is used for machine learning models
   * Basic Statistics

- Types : 
   * Supervised 
   * Unsupervised Learning. 
   
   1. **Supervised learning** is when we have a known target based on past data (for example, predicting what price a house will sell for) 
      * classification 
      * regression problems
   
   2. **Unsupervised learning** is when there isn't a known past answer (for example, determining the topics discussed in restaurant reviews).

- **Regression** is predicting a numerical value (for example, predicting what price a house will sell for) 
- **Classification** is predicting what class something belongs to (for example, predicting if a borrower will default on their loan).

- **Classification problems** are the problems where weâ€™re predicting which class something belongs to.
   * Examples will include:
      * Predicting who would survive the Titanic crash
      * Determining a handwritten digit from an image
      * Using biopsy data to classify if a lump is cancerous

   * Techniques to tackle these classification problems: 
      * Logistic Regression
      * Decision Trees
      * Random Forests
      * Neural Networks

 *Sololearn course will focus on supervised learning and classification.*
