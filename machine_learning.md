## The Basics

# Welcome to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a way of taking data and turning it into insights.
We use computer power to analyze examples from the past to build a model that can predict the result for new examples.

- Machine learning models every day : 
   * Netflix recommendations 
   * Amazon Pricing System 
   * credit card company calls based on suspicious activity (anamolous behaviour prediction models)

In this course weâ€™ll learn several techniques for solving machine learning problems.
Machine Learning can be used to create a chatbot, detect spam or image recognition.
